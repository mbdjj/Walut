Walut is a simple app which allows you to check current currency rates. It's written in SwiftUI and uses [exchangerate-api.com's API](https://exchangerate-api.com).

## Localization

Walut is currently localized in English and Polish. If you'd like to see it in your native language, and you would like to help, you can reach out to me at [marcin@bartminski.dev](mailto:marcin@bartminski.dev).

## Open source

All the code I wrote to complete the project is open-source so you can check out my solutions and of course help me make my app better. I'm open to any suggestions.
